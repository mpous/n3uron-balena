# n3uron IIoT gateway running on balena

This is a reference architecture to run on your Industrial ioT Edge gateway using N3uron, HiveMQ on balena.

N3uron is an IIoT edge platform which provides data acquisition from multiple industrial protocols (e.g. Modbus, OPC UA, and more), connectivity with Historian or MQTT brokers, data processing and more. It also includes features such as real-time monitoring and data visualization. N3uron works as a swiss knife designed to help industrial organizations to make data-driven decisions based on insights collected from their IIoT data.
